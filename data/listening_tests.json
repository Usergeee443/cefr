Coffee houses, known as qahveh khaneh, began to appear in cities throughout the Middle East.\n\nEuropeans first encountered coffee in the 17th century when Venetian traders brought it to Italy.\n\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to establish coffee plantations in their colonies, starting in Java, Indonesia.\n\nToday, coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world after oil.

We're seeing coral bleaching events more frequent than ever. Fish populations are declining due to overfishing. And perhaps most concerning is the plastic pollution problem.\n\nInterviewer: What do you think is the biggest threat?\n\nDr. Chen: Climate change. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, change fish migration patterns, and as oceans warm they absorb more carbon dioxide, making them more acidic.\n\nInterviewer: What can ordinary people do?\n\nDr. Chen: Support policies that protect marine areas. That's the most impactful thing.\n\nInterviewer: Are there success stories?\n\nDr. Chen: When we protect areas properly, nature can recover remarkably quickly.\n\nInterviewer: What's next for your research?\n\nDr. Chen: Mapping microplastic distribution in the Pacific Ocean.",
