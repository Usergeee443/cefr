It is not, in principle, necessary for a biological system to age and die. Nevertheless, a restricted life span, ageing, and then death are basic characteristics of life. The reason for this is easy to recognise: in nature, the existent organisms either adapt or are regularly replaced by new types. Because of changes in the genetic material (mutations) these have new characteristics and in the course of their individual lives they are tested for optimal or better adaptation to the environmental conditions. Immortality would disrupt this system—it needs room for new and better life. This is the basic problem of evolution."

There are striking differences in life span between different species of animals, but within one species the parameter is relatively constant. For example, the average duration of human life has hardly changed in thousands of years. Although more and more people attain an advanced age as a result of developments in medical care and better nutrition, the characteristic upper limit for most remains 80 years. A further argument against the simple 'wear and tear' theory can be seen in the fact that the time within which organisms age lies between a few hours (for a unicellular organism) and several thousand years (for mammoth trees)."

Like the life span, the metabolic rate has for different organisms a fixed mathematical relationship to the body mass. In comparison to the life span this relationship is 'inverted': the larger the organism the lower its metabolic rate. Again this relationship is valid not only for birds, but also, similarly on average within the systematic unit, for all other organisms (plants, animals, unicellular organisms)."

Thus they are not able to 'experience life' and so they attain a high life span in captivity. Animals which save energy by hibernation or lethargy (e.g. bats or hedgehogs) live much longer than those which are always active. The metabolic rate of mice can be reduced by a very low consumption of food (hunger diet). They then live twice as long as their well-fed comrades. Women live distinctly longer than men. If you examine the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the higher male metabolic rate roughly accounts for the lower male life span. That means that they live life 'energetically'—more intensively, but not for as long."

Relaxation lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate sleep and in general an equable and balanced personality. Each of us can develop his or her own 'energy saving programme' with a little self-observation, critical self-control and, above all, logical consistency. Experience will show that to live in this way not only increases the life span but is also very healthy. This final aspect should not be forgotten."

From the virtual assistants on our smartphones to the algorithms that recommend what we should watch next, AI has become an invisible but powerful force shaping our decisions and experiences.\n\nProponents of AI point to its tremendous potential for improving human life. In healthcare, AI systems can analyze medical images with greater accuracy than human doctors, potentially catching diseases at earlier, more treatable stages. In environmental science, AI helps researchers model climate patterns and develop strategies for conservation. The technology has also revolutionized industries from manufacturing to finance, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nHowever, critics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of AI advancement. One of the most pressing issues is the potential for widespread job displacement. As AI systems become capable of performing tasks previously done by humans, millions of workers may find themselves unemployed. This technological unemployment could exacerbate social inequality if the benefits of AI are not distributed fairly.\n\nAnother concern is the question of bias in AI systems. Because these systems learn from data created by humans, they can inherit and even amplify existing prejudices. There have been documented cases of AI systems discriminating against certain groups in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice.\n\nPrivacy is yet another area of concern. AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data to function effectively. This raises questions about who has access to our information and how it might be used. The potential for surveillance and manipulation is significant, particularly when AI is combined with facial recognition technology.\n\nDespite these challenges, many experts believe that the benefits of AI outweigh the risks, provided that appropriate safeguards are put in place. This includes developing ethical guidelines for AI development, creating regulations to prevent misuse, and investing in education to prepare workers for a changing job market.",

Cities consume the majority of the world's energy and produce most of its waste, yet they are also centers of innovation, culture, and economic growth.\n\nSmart city technologies are already being deployed in many places. Sensors can monitor traffic flow and adjust signals in real time. Public transport systems use data to optimize routes and reduce waiting times. In some cities, streetlights dim when no one is nearby, saving energy. Waste collection is becoming more efficient with bins that signal when they are full.\n\nHowever, technology alone cannot solve urban problems. Affordable housing remains a critical issue in many cities, and inequality often increases as cities grow. Planners must balance economic development with social inclusion and environmental sustainability.
